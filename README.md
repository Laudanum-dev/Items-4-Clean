# Items-4-Clean
repo for some items i'm trying to make. currently it's supposed to be working on 4.41+, won't work on versions prior
see https://github.com/Laudanum-dev/Items-4-Clean/projects for all plans about this package

# how to install
use that green button above. you can paste it as a folder in `packages` or as a zip (make sure that in root of zip is file `info.txt`)
